# SecureMe

SecureMe is a simple Android app targeted at platforms 2.2+ (which covers 100% of all Android versions in use) that automagically helps users secure their Android devices by checking for and explaining common security settings. For example, securing a lock screen with a password, PIN, or pattern lock; enabling encryption; enabling remote acess with Android Device Manager; and other security-related configurations. Instead of users having to look up how to secure their devices, SecureMe tells users at a quick glance which security settings they have configured well (either manually or by default) and which settings they should take a look at to improve the security of their Android device.
